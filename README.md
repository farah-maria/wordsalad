# **Women in Coding History (WICH)**

Did you know that women have been writing machine-readable code since the 1840s? And that coding used to be considered "women's work"? Yet according to a Statista poll taken in 2021, only 5% of software developers worldwide are female.

This site is both a general interest and educational resource that shows how women have in fact shaped the world of coding since its inception, from before the first computing device was even invented. The website includes an illustrated timeline. This will eventually include current and future projects being headed by female coders, not just historical figures. I also hope to add a page with links to resources for women and girls who want to learn more about coding and the tech industry. 

The project is a work in progress, with more figures who need including on the timeline. It is aimed at both school children and adults who do not necessarily know much about programming, tech, or the history behind its development. Any technical terms used are therefore explained in simple and accessible language. 

The objective is to educate and engage women and girls who would not "normally" be interested in this subject or who are new to it. The colour palette and imagery is therefore gentle, non-glaring, friendly, and "soft". The site is meant to be inviting to those who might otherwise feel intimidated by tech talk. 

The greater aim is to contribute towards gender equality in the field of software engineering and to raise awareness of the great accomplishments already been achieved by female coders. The knowledge of positive role models, past and present, will hopefully inspire women and girls to feel "I could do this, too!"

## **User Experience, Scope & Design**

Accessibility is an important part of this project, not only it is central to how this particular work is being assessed but because, as mentioned above, this is a site aimed at a non-specialist audience aged 13 years and up. Young readers need content that is easier to understand and navigate, as do those who may not describe themselves as “tech-savvy”.
Simple language is used throughout the site for this reason, and the inclusion of images and media links keeps the content varied, engaging and educational for those who want to explore more about the female coders introduced on the timeline.
A timeline format was used as this lay-out is simple to follow, carrying the reader from the 1840s to the current day. Entries that describe female coders through history are short and concise, aimed at the concentration levels of a young audience or an adult scrolling through the internet in their coffee break. 

The homepage and feedback form are therefore minimalist, with little content, and get straight to the point. The focus is clear – the timeline. But the landing page is also attractive in a “soft” way that is pleasing to the eye, and as discussed in the introduction, uses a gentle palette of colours that puts the audience at ease. 

<br>

<br>

The imagery of nature and trees is used subtly throughout for the headings and footers, as nature generally helps people to relax. The imagery of trees also feeds into the idea of growth – personal growth through learning and evolution through time. Family trees are used to illustrate the growth of a family through many years, and the idea of using tree-imagery on a history site came from this usage.

The site is not aimed at very young primary school aged children, where the use of bright colours and busy content would have been more appropriate. However, I used to be a Montessori teacher, and the site would be suitable for some elementary school aged children in such an educational setting (where over-busy decoration is discouraged, and natural colours are used more often).
The colour palette of lilacs, blues, greens and soft brown is meant to reflect nature through use of the colours of flowers, grass, sky and trees. The surface level of the website is therefore entirely designed to put the eye, and the audience, at ease and to let the reader feel gently invited to the content.

Simplicity is at the heart of the basic navigation structure: a homepage that introduces the subject area and content of the site in one line, and just two other navigation options… The timeline and a feedback page. Consistency of design is used throughout the site, in terms of the headers and footers and the location of these features. The site is easy and simple to follow. This was a priority right from the onset of designing the site, when I hand-drew my wireframes...

<br>

<br>
<center>2. <img src="assets/images/frame-two.jpg" alt="wireframe drawing of timeline page in landscape" width="30%"/></center>

<br>
<center>5. <img src="assets/images/frame-four.jpg" alt="wireframe drawing of landing page that says thank for submitting your form "width="30%"/></center>
<br>

Image one  is the homepage, images two and three are of the timeline, image four is the feedback page and image five is a 'thank you' page that pops up to confirm successful submission of the form.

A few minor aspects of design changed after the wireframing process. The hero image, for example, contains a lot of empty space in the middle, so it was better suited as a background image with what I called the 'blurb' going across the centre rather than underneath. I asked a friend to open the homepage on his computer with a large desktop, and he found that it was still very empty-looking after this change in design, so I veered away from my choice of the courier font (which evokes a historical sense of "typing" code using an old machine) for larger desktops. A more attractive, decorative font was employed just for bigger screens to address this issue. I chose "Homemade Apple" from Google Fonts as this worked well with the handwritten-style header (the font used for the header is "Permanent Marker", also from Google Fonts) in suggesting a first draft of history that's still being written. It also softens the page, giving a more homely feel, helping the user feel they are in their comfort zone despite being taught about a technical subject.

The combination of "Open Sans" (also from Google Fonts) for small text on the site with "Permanent Marker" for the header is a pairing suggested by Canva [Canva website](canva.com/learn/best-google-font-combinations).

The 'thank you' page that I planned, as confirmation to the user that their feedback form had been successfully submitted, fell away as the scope of the project became more limited given the time constraints. This is something I would like to add later. Instead, there is a standard Code Institute "form dump" confirmation message that pops us after data is successfully sent. 

I wanted to include links to the educational curricula in Ireland and the UK for teachers using the site for class, ideally during the week of international women's day, but I decided early on in the wireframing process that the scope would have to exclude this due to time constraints. This can be added as the website develops, along with an easily-printable format for the timeline, so that the history page can be used as a hand-out for students. I kept the scope quite basic, with space for additional content. The focus is on simply informing the user of the history of women in coding... A basic but attractive educational site that is also suitable for general interest.

## Design Responsivity, User Experience & Scope/ Strategy

Design responsivity for different devices is essential for positive user experiences. According to a recent article  by the online magazine Design Rush (15 Screen Resolutions to Design For | DesignRush), 90% of website visitors bounce due to poor design. So, after creating an elaborate desktop design for the homepage (which didn’t work on smaller screens) I decided to start again from scratch with a mobile first approach, with the awareness that a majority of website visits in general happen via smart phone. 

Accessibility is an important part of my website, as it is partly aimed at a non-tech-savvy audience who are less likely to have elaborate, expensive devices for viewing web pages. A young audience – especially the school student community - is also less likely to have the funds, as they do not control their own budget or income. So, I researched the most common screen sizes and set my scope for design responsivity around these. According to the Design Rush article already mentioned, which is based on statistics from StatCounter, the most common screen sizes for mobile phone are somewhere between 320 and 667 pixels wide and between 480 and 812 pixels tall. I tested the design of my site and created media queries with a focus on this in terms of mobile phone devices. However, these parameters only accounted for 45% of web surfers between March 2019 and March 2020, and there are now even more mobile phone sizes in use. Mobile phones clearly account for the most varied and unpredictable screen sizes in use, and so I did make sure that my media queries included sizes above and beyond the parameters discussed in Design Rush magazine…
The website is fully responsive from the smallest screen size of an iPhone 4.  Foldables and wearables were not included in the scope for the above reasons (they are less commonly used and RE associated with people with a higher level of tech-awareness and appreciation). 

According to research (the same article), tablet sizes and desktop sizes (including laptops) are far more predictable, in terms of assessing what most people use, so I strongly focused on the most common screen sizes for these types of devices when it came to testing my site using Chrome dev tools and creating specific media queries targeting these screen sizes.

The five most common desktop screen resolutions worldwide are: 1366 x 768px; 1536 x 864px; 1440 x 900px; 1920 x 1090px and 1280 x 720px. This includes laptops, and these screen-size users accounted for 63% of web surfing. While including media queries and dev testing for other screen sizes, I strongly focused on these. The site is optimised to look good and be accessible when it comes to how content is presented on these screen sizes. Strong contrast between content and background (colours, fonts, information boxes), and making sure the screen is not too "busy", have been priorities for these sized screens.

Tablets are even more predictable/ standard in size. The 5 most common tablet sizes used to surf the net between March 2019 and March 2020, according to StatCounter, were 1024 x 768px; 1280 x 800px, 800 x 1280px (the same device in portrait); 962 x 601px and 601 x 962px (the same device in portrait). This accounted for 70% of tablet users. While including media queries and doing dev testing for other dimensions, I strongly focused on these. The site is optimised to look good and be accessible when it comes to how content is presented on these screen sizes. Strong contrast between content and background (colours, fonts, information boxes), and making sure the screen is not too "busy", have been priorities for these sized screens

## Existing Features

It is hard to completely separate the topics that need attention in this document, so there is some overlap, but I will avoid repeating descriptions.

-_Navigation Bar_

As suggested above, in the section on user experience and design, the header and navigation bar are on all three pages of the website. The navigation bar is part of the header and is fully responsive, containing links to the homepage, the history timeline and the feedback form. At no point does the user need to hit the ‘back’ button to access a page they were on previously, as each available option is clearly displayed in the same area of each page and is easily ‘clickable’. This is true regardless of whether the site is being accessed via mobile, tablet, laptop of desktop. I have tried to balance creativity with consistency. As the site focuses on new discoveries and breakthroughs made by innovative women, I wanted to avoid translating consistency as “sameness”, while recognizing that the user needs to know where they are on the navigation journey. Consistency is important, especially for the visually impaired, so they have a clear sense that they are on the same website even if they are on a different page. Here are the three headers, containing the nav bards, with the same main title and logo on each page...

<br>
<center>Homepage <br><img src="assets/images/homenav.png" alt="screenshot of homepage header with navigation bar" width="50%"/></center>
<br>
<center>Timeline page <br><img src="assets/images/timelinenav.png" alt="screenshot of navigation bar on history page" width="50%"/></center>     
<br>
<center>Feedback page <br><img src="assets/images/formnav.png" alt="screenshot of navigation bar on feedback page" width="50%"/></center>
<br>     

The style and font is the same for each of the three navigation bars, except on small mobile devices where a border and background colour were added for the feedback page to improve visibility of the navigation options (the form necessitated a smaller font-size). The colours used are still from the same colour palette. I kept the header and navigation identical for the first two pages of the mobile version, with the understanding that a smaller screen gives less visual clues, making consistency in design even more important.

<br>     
 
The top screenshot was taken on my Huawei P30 lite phone. The second is on the dimensions of an iPhone 4, created using Chrome dev tools. 

There is a hover effect for the options on the navbars, to help the user see that the labels on the header are interactive and 'clickable', and also a colour effect to show if the page has already been visited. This is to help the reader understand the functionality of the navigation bar and to remind them of what they have already viewed, creating a clear sense of where they are on their journey through the site.

-_Footer with Social Media Links_-

The same footer design is used on all three pages with a hover effect to indicate interactivity. There are three icons for Facebook, Twitter and YouTube taken from the Font Awesome library. As with the navigation bar on the mobile version of the site, the feedback page has a border around the icons so that they clearly stand out on a small screen. The style and colour of the border is the same. Tablets also have a slightly tweaked design for the footer, which is a compromise between the full-size design for large desktops and the boxed footer for mobiles. It consists of the same background illustration that's used for desktops, but with the addition of a grey border to draw emphasis to the links on a smaller screen. The links on the footer do work, but I have yet to set up a social media presence for the WICH project. 

-_Landing Page & WICH Logo_-

As shown at the start of this document, the landing page, or homepage, is simple, minimalist but informative, with a natural and gentle colour palette. The words 'Women coders since the 1840...' informs the user of the content they should expect from the next page. The navigation label 'timeline' at the top of the page also introduces how this information is going to be presented. The hero image of a keyboard on a pink desk is attractive as well as functional in conveying the main themes of women at work in computer technology and coding. 

The icon used for the logo is from the Font Awesome library [Font Awesome website](fontawesome.com) and clearly indicates the subject matter of computing, while the shades of pink on the home page are a wry reference to what is stereotypically thought of as 'feminine taste'. The logo and title heading are repeated on all three pages.

The WICH acronym was fun to come up with, and obviously points to the word 'witch'. This is intended to evoke the history of confident, intelligent women being considered oddballs and outsiders. Women software developers are, after all, still a small minority.

All of the fonts are from Google Fonts [Google Fonts website](fonts.google.com), except for Courier. Courier is used on the landing page for smaller screens, as it is clearer to read and still in line with the themes of coding and history (i.e. typewriters).

The hero image is by @lum3n and can be downloaded free of charge from Unsplash [Unsplash web address](https://unsplash.com/photos/-RBuQ2PK_L8).

The tree wallpaper design used as a background throughout the site as been edited to different sizes and hues by me, but the original can be downloaded from the Creative Tacos site, which has a beautiful collection of free design resources. To find free background wallpaper options, look up 'digital papers' on https://creativetacos.com/ 

-_Timeline_-

The timeline is the main focus of the website and it is where the most of the content is concentrated. Fourteen women coders are described, from Ada Lovelace's annotations on machine coding in 1843 to Valerie Johnson's current work as an advocate for women and people of colour in the tech industry. 

Descriptions of each figure are short and easy to understand with technical terms such as "compiler" fully explained, making the timeline a bit of an introduction to the world of computing in general.

Every description is accompanied by an image, and most are accompanied by a link to audio or video material for users who want to know more. Most people, especially young people, learn through all of their senses, not just through sight, so it was important to include audio material as well as videos that provide a 'break' from pure text. 

Every image has an 'alt' tag, for users with visual impairments.

The timeline has a different background for phones than for tablets and larger desktops. The smaller the device, the fewer colours used. I did not want to crowd the page with strong colours and contrasts for mobile phone screens, as this can affect concentration. The bigger desktops have background wallpaper for the timeline to add interest where the background might otherwise look too bare. 

The wallpaper idea, also used for the headings and footers, was inspired by William Morris and the Arts and Crafts Movement. The movement roughly correlates with the period when machine readable code started being talked about. Morris began his apprenticeship as an embroiderer of textiles in the mid-1800s, when Ada Lovelace was working as a mathematician in the same city (London). Both were associated with radical politics (Morris was a socialist and Ada Lovelace was the daughter of Lord Byron).

<br>   

Code for the timeline was borrowed from the following website: https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/html-css-timelines. However, there were numerous bugs in the code, which I had to fix so that it worked on all sized screens. I'll discuss these later.

All images for the timeline are open source, and from Wikimedia Commons (https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page). 

All links have an aria-label to help visually impaired users, and they open in a separate tab. The links are coloured violet to set them apart from the non-interactive text. 

-_Feedback Form_-

The feedback form is responsive and functional on all different devices from the size of an iPhone 4 up. I already knew how to code forms from my HTML course material, however I taught myself how to make a fully responsive one from W3 schools "HOW TO - Responsive Form" at http://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_responsive_form.asp/.

I have yet to make this form active beyond the data being sent to the Code Institute form dump address. To make this website a functioning site of current use, the main thing I need to do is to change this, so that I receive the data and am able to respond to the feedback in how I develop the project in future.

When I learn JavaScript later in my diploma course, I will use this language to code a properly interactive form with a pop up page that says "Thank you for submitting your feedback!". 

As the timeline project is at its inception stage, I deliberately wanted a feedback form with space for whatever views users have. This is why there is a large text box. I'm effectively gathering views as if I'm holding a market research event, with the first users giving a full account of their views, first impressions and feelings. Later, when the project gathers momentum and there is a social media presence for WICH, I will narrow the options down on the form to radio button answers to specific questions.  

The email address box only accepts text that is recognisably in the format of a proper email address (a validated and required input field). The form is not submitted unless an email address is entered. The addresses will eventually be used, when this site is live and fully functioning, for updates and possibly a newsletter or blog.

## **Testing (and bugs!)**

Two key aspects of this project are accessibility and design responsivity (media queries). To test for accessibility, I used the Lighthouse report generator in Chrome dev tools to check that the accessibility scores for the desktop and mobile versions of the site were over 70%. 

<br>
<center><img src="assets/images/desk_lighthouse.png" alt="screenshot of lighthouse report for desktop version of the site" width="80%"/></center>
<br>  

<br>
<center><img src="assets/images/mob_lighthouse.png" alt="screenshot of lighthouse report for mobile version of the site" width="80%"/></center>
<br>  

The screenshots of the report are above. The first one is for the desktop version and the second one for mobiles. Despite my efforts to start from scratch a week into the project with a mobile first approach, it is the desktop version that scores most highly on all-round performance. The specific score for accessibility is 97%. The mobile version has the same score, with both versions of the site - mobile and desktop - also scoring 100% on best practice. This meant that thankfully, I did not have to go back to the drawing-board for this project. The accessibility scores are well above 70%.

I also tested the site on real devices by checking how it looked on my phone (Huawei P30 lite), my friends' devices (I asked them send me screenshots), my tablet (Surface Go) and by checking all of the most common screen sizes from the smallest size of 320 x 480 pixels (the dimensions for the iphone4). I also tested the points at which the integrity of the webpages fell apart using Chrome dev tools. I used these to guide the creation of further media queries in my CSS code to remedy the 'glitches', so that when I played with the width and height in Chrome dev tools, the design seamlessly adapted. I learned about this adaptive approach from a 'Sam's Teach Yourself' textbook that I have on CSS and HTML. "Focus your breakpoints on where your design starts to fail rather than worrying about specific devices or widths. It's also a good idea to strive for as few breakpoints as your design can handle and not be broken" (p.468, Colburn, Kyrnin & Lemay 2016). If I could go back and do this project again, I would certainly aim for less media queries. The feedback form in particular required a lot of adjustments in CSS for different screen sizes, and even though the code "works" and my course mentor was happy with the design responsivity for all of the pages of the site, I could have saved a lot of time and effort if I simply taught myself CSS grids and used this for the whole of the feedback page.

I noticed early on that Chrome dev tools do not show how a site looks like on a given device in real life. This is because the browser adds elements to the top and the bottom of the page, and these are difficult to predict it varies with different browsers. When I tested the homepage on my phone, the footer dropped off the screen, but it was visible for the same dimensions in Chrome dev tools. I was told, for the sake for how this project is being assessed, to focus on what is shown by Chrome dev tools. However, I couldn't leave it alone, because I want this site to be of actual real-life use. I have coded the footer to come up higher on mobile devices so that it is always visible. It turns out that this makes the footer stand out more on smaller screens, so it probably pushed up the accessibility score on the Lighthouse report.   

The timeline code turned out to not work in its entirety on different devices after it had been amended by me to include images and different fonts/ colours. Specifically, there was a join in the timeline that was visibly out of alignment. I used Chrome dev tools to click on this, and discover which bit of code needed amending. A similar issue came up that related to the dots on the timeline. They were not on the actual timeline, but floating off away from the descriptions about each woman in history. I found the bug in the same way and created a series of media queries that fix this for different screen sizes.

I tested all of the links on the history line to make sure they were up to date and functional when clicked on. A bug that came up initially was that some of the links didn't work. The 'position: relative' style automatically gave the elements a z-index, so part of the div element was covering the link, making it unclickable. I worked this out with the help of a tutor. My adding 'position: relative' to the style for the links in CSS, this got fixed.

 ## **Code Validation (and bugs!)**

 The HTML for the landing page, the timeline page and the feedback page all passed when I copied and pasted the code into the free w3 validator service online. The screenshots are below.  

<br>

<br>

<br>
<center><img src="assets/images/form_html_validation.png" alt="screenshot of pass report for feedback page from HTML validator" width="80%"/></center>
<br>

The CSS code for the website also passed when it was cut and paste into the Jigsaw w3 validation service online. The screenshot showing this is below.

<br>
<center><img src="assets/images/css_validation.png" alt="screenshot of pass report for CSS code page from Jigsaw w3 validator" width="80%"/></center>
<br>

No errors were found in the HTML or the CSS code when tested two days prior to the submission of this project. Before this, however, there were some bugs I needed to swat! A few errors were found by the validator that I had to fix. It turned out that my history timeline was riddled with tags that were not closed properly... Below is an example.

<br>
<center><img src="assets/images/bugs.png" alt="screenshot of errors found by w3 HTML validator" width="80%"/></center>
<br>

I went through the HTML with a fine toothcomb and discovered the problem. I was trying to wrap block elements with inline elements, and this meant that my paragraphs weren't closing properly. I fixed this, and correctly ordered my tags. I removed the use of divs to style the links embedded in various paragraphs, remembering that divs are used as outer-wrappers. I needed to be using the span element to style these links instead. My code passed after making these changes.

## **Deployment**

I used GitHub pages to deploy my site. The process is simple. Click on 'settings' after going into the repository and scroll down. The menu down the lefthand side will have an option called 'pages'. Click on this, and after a few moments the site will be deployed and GitHub will automatically show a web address in blue. This is the address for the live site, which anyone can now access from their own devices.
